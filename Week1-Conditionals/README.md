# CS50 Python ‚Äì Week 1: Conditionals Solution Set üêç

This directory contains solutions to the exercises from **Week 1** of CS50‚Äôs *Introduction to Programming with Python*. This week focuses on **decision-making** using conditionals (`if`, `elif`, and `else`) to create programs that can adapt to different inputs and scenarios.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The folder includes solutions to the following exercises:

1. **Deep Thought**: Respond to user questions about life, the universe, and everything.
2. **Home Federal Savings Bank**: Categorize a greeting based on politeness (e.g., "hello").
3. **File Extensions**: Determine file types based on their extensions (e.g., `.jpg` for images).
4. **Math Interpreter**: Perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
5. **Meal Time**: Determine which meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) corresponds to a given time.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone this Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the `Week1-Conditionals` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgambirSingh/CS50-Python.git
cd CS50-Python/Week1-Conditionals
```

### 2. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) if you haven‚Äôt already.

### 3. Run the Programs
Execute the Python files using:
```bash
python <filename>.py
```

## üåü Key Concepts Covered

The solutions in this directory highlight:

- **Conditional Logic**: Writing `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks to handle various scenarios.
- **String Manipulation**: Parsing, modifying, and analyzing strings to drive program logic.
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Incorporating math-based logic into decision-making programs.

## üíª Exercises Breakdown

### 1. **Deep Thought**
Respond to user input, especially the question "What is the meaning of life?" with the canonical answer "42."

### 2. **Home Federal Savings Bank**
Categorize greetings like "hello" or "hi" to determine monetary rewards:
- "$0" for rude inputs.
- "$20" for polite, incomplete greetings.
- "$100" for full, polite greetings ("hello").

### 3. **File Extensions**
Use conditionals to identify file types based on their extensions:
- `.jpg`, `.png` ‚Üí Image
- `.pdf` ‚Üí Document
- `.mp3` ‚Üí Audio

### 4. **Math Interpreter**
Parse a user-provided mathematical expression (e.g., `3 + 4`) and compute its result.

### 5. **Meal Time**
Convert a 24-hour time (e.g., "7:30") into meal times:
- Breakfast: 6:00‚Äì9:00
- Lunch: 12:00‚Äì14:00
- Dinner: 18:00‚Äì21:00

## ‚ú® Example Usage

### Run the File Extensions program:
```bash
python extensions.py
```

Input:
```
Filename: photo.jpg
```

Output:
```
image/jpeg
```
