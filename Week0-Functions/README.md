# CS50 Python – Week 0: Functions Solution Set 🐍

This repository contains solutions to the exercises from **Week 0** of CS50’s *Introduction to Programming with Python*. Week 0 covers the foundational concepts of programming and Python functions. Each solution showcases clean code, adherence to best practices, and a step-by-step approach to problem-solving.

## 📁 Repository Structure
This folder focuses specifically on **functions** and includes solutions to the following exercises:

1. **Hello, World**: A simple program to print a greeting.
2. **Playback Speed**: Simulate slow playback by replacing spaces with ellipses.
3. **Making Faces**: Convert textual emoticons like `:)` and `:(` to their emoji equivalents.
4. **Einstein**: Calculate energy from mass using Einstein’s equation \(E = mc^2\).
5. **Tip Calculator**: Compute a tip based on user input for bill amount and desired percentage.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the solutions on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the `Week0-Functions` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgambirSingh/CS50-Python.git
cd CS50-Python/Week0-Functions
```

### 2. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/) if you haven’t already.

### 3. Run the Programs
Run each solution file using Python:
```bash
python <filename>.py
```

### Example:
To execute the **Hello, World** solution:
```bash
python hello.py
```

## 🌟 Key Concepts Covered
The solutions in this directory emphasize:
- **Input/Output**: Handling user input and displaying output.
- **Data Types**: Strings, numbers, and basic operations.
- **Logic**: Using conditionals and comparisons.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable and modular code.

## 💻 Exercises Breakdown
### 1. **Hello, World**
The classic first program! Outputs a simple greeting to the user.

### 2. **Playback Speed**
Converts text input by replacing spaces with ellipses to mimic a "slow playback" effect.

### 3. **Making Faces**
Transforms emoticons like `:)` and `:(` into emojis 😊 and 😢 using Python functions.

### 4. **Einstein**
Implements \(E = mc^2\) where the user provides mass (`m`), and the program calculates energy (`E`).

### 5. **Tip Calculator**
Prompts the user for a bill amount and a tip percentage, then calculates the total tip.
