# Generation Identifier
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/9Pqde8v-0ak>
#### Description:
The **Generation Identifier** is a Python-based program that analyzes text to determine the generational category it most closely aligns with. It categorizes input into one of the following:
- **Gen Z**: Known for modern slang like "lit" and "no cap."
- **Boomer**: Associated with nostalgic phrases like "groovy" and "far out."
- **Gen Alpha**: Reflects the influence of newer expressions such as "yeet" and "sus."

Additionally, the program can identify combinations of generations, reflecting the blending of language across age groups. If no match is found, it returns "Unknown Generation."

---

## How It Works

- The program relies on keyword-based analysis. It matches specific slang or phrases in the input text with predefined lists of words associated with each generation.
- If the text contains keywords from multiple generations, it identifies and outputs a combination (e.g., "Gen Z and Gen Alpha").
- If no relevant keywords are detected, it outputs "Unknown Generation."

## Key Features

- **Generational Insights:** Identifies whether text belongs to **Gen Z**, **Boomer**, or **Gen Alpha.**
- **Combination Detection:** Recognizes overlapping language trends between generations, providing mixed results when applicable.
- **Simple and Engaging:** Designed to be user-friendly while highlighting the evolution of language.

## Use Cases

1. **Educational Tool:** Demonstrates how language evolves across generations.
2. **Fun Activity:** Allows users to test their knowledge of generational slang.
3. **Cultural Insight:** Shows how different age groups influence communication styles.

## Future Scope

- Integrating **audio analysis** to identify generational speech patterns from spoken words.
- Expanding the keyword database for greater accuracy and inclusivity.
- Exploring **machine learning models** for advanced and context-aware text analysis.

This project demonstrates how subtle language differences can reveal broader cultural trends, blending technical innovation with societal insights. It was developed as part of the CS50 Introduction to Programming course to showcase creativity, programming skills, and real-world applications of computational thinking.
